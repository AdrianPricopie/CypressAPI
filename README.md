# CypressAPI Project

## Overview
CypressAPI is a project designed to demonstrate API testing using Cypress. This project includes a series of tests to validate the functionality of various API endpoints, ensuring their reliability and performance.

- **editor code used: vscode**
- **Library Versions:**
    ```bash
     cypress-mochawesome-reporter
    
   ```
## Application under the test
- The application under test is available at [QA Challenge API](https://qachallenge.ro/api/). This API provides various endpoints for testing purposes, allowing the validation of different functionalities and scenarios.


## Features
- **Automated API Testing**: Uses Cypress to automate the testing of API endpoints.
- **Test Scenarios**: Includes comprehensive test scenarios to cover different use cases.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup and configuration to start testing immediately.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AdrianPricopie/CypressAPI.git
   cd CypressAPI
2. Run all the tests:
   ```sh
   npm test run
   ```

### Types Available for Testing
The QA Challenge API supports the following HTTP methods for testing: GET, POST and DELETE. Below are some examples of operations you can perform:
Create, Read, Update(but its work with post in postman and cypress/javascript), Delete (CRUD) Operations

### Get All Users
- **Endpoint**: `http://qachallenge.ro/api/test_api.php?action=fetch_all`
- **Action**: Fetch all users

### Get Single User
- **Endpoint**: `http://qachallenge.ro/api/test_api.php?action=fetch_single&id=X`
- **Action**: Fetch a single user by ID
- **Parameters**:
  - `id=X`: ID of the specific user

### Insert User
- **Endpoint**: `http://qachallenge.ro/api/test_api.php?action=insert`
- **Action**: Insert a new user
- **Parameters**:
  - `first_name=YYYYY`: First name of the user
  - `last_name=ZZZZZZ`: Last name of the user

### Update User
- **Endpoint**: `http://qachallenge.ro/api/test_api.php?action=update&id=X`
- **Action**: Update an existing user
- **Parameters**:
  - `id=X`: ID of the specific user
  - `first_name=YYYYY`: First name of the user
  - `last_name=ZZZZZZ`: Last name of the user

### Delete User
- **Endpoint**: `http://qachallenge.ro/api/test_api.php?action=delete&id=X`
- **Action**: Delete an existing user
- **Parameters**:
  - `id=X`: ID of the specific user

# Issue Report: Validate Inserting a User with Empty First Name and Last Name

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Execute the test script "Validate inserting a user with empty firstname and lastname".
2. Observe the test result.

## Expected Behavior
The test script should verify that you cannot insert a valid user with the first name and last name fields left empty, and you should get a success: "0" response body.

## Actual Behavior
You get a success: "1" response body.

# issue Report: Unable to Delete User with Invalid ID Key

## description
The API endpoint for deleting a user returns a success response (`success: "1"`) even when an incorrect key for the user ID is provided. The expected behavior is to receive a null response, indicating failure.

## Expected Behavior
The API should return a null response body, indicating the deletion failed due to the incorrect ID key.

## Actual Behavior
The API returns a response with body `[{"succes":"1"}]`, indicating the deletion was successful despite the incorrect ID key.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Call the API endpoint for deleting a user with an incorrect key for the user ID.
2. Observe the response.

### Conclusion

The CypressAPI project effectively demonstrates API testing using Cypress, validating various endpoints of the QA Challenge API. While most of the tests run successfully, two critical issues have been identified during testing. Below is a summary of the project's achievements and the issues encountered:

#### Project Achievements

- **Automated API Testing**: Successfully implemented Cypress to automate the testing of API endpoints.
- **Comprehensive Test Scenarios**: Included a wide range of test scenarios to cover various use cases, ensuring robust validation.
- **Easy Configuration**: Provided a simple setup and configuration process, allowing for quick initiation of tests.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Utilized cypress-mochawesome-reporter to generate detailed test reports, showcasing the number of tests passed and failed.

#### Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 10
- **Tests Passed**: 8
- **Tests Failed**: 2

#### Identified Issues

1. **Issue with Inserting a User with Empty First Name and Last Name**:
   - **Expected Behavior**: The API should return `success: "0"` when attempting to insert a user with empty first name and last name fields.
